// Sent when this wl_buffer is no longer used by the compositor.
// The client is now free to reuse or destroy this buffer and its
// backing storage.
//
// If a client receives a release event before the frame callback
// requested in the same wl_surface.commit that attaches this
// wl_buffer to a surface, then the client is immediately free to
// reuse the buffer and its backing storage, and does not need a
// second buffer for the next surface content update. Typically
// this is possible, when the compositor maintains a copy of the
// wl_surface contents, e.g. as a GL texture. This is an important
// optimization for GL(ES) compositors with wl_shm clients.
